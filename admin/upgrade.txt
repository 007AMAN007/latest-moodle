This files describes API changes in /admin/*.

=== 3.3 ===

* The admin setting admin_setting_configselect now support the optgroup tag. Grouping of options can be created with this new tag.
  For using this new option, the option parameters needs the Group names as indexes:
  [
    "Spain" =>  ["madrid" => "Madrid", "barcelona" => "Barcelona"],
    "France" => ["paris" => "Paris", "marseille" => "Marseille"],
  ]

=== 3.2 ===

* Admin settings have been refined to better support right-to-left languages. In RTL,
  most fields should not have their direction flipped, a URL, a path to a file, ...
  are always displayed LTR. The admin setting will now best guess if they should be
  RTLized based on their PARAM_* type. To override that guess, use
  admin_setting::set_force_ltr(true/false).
