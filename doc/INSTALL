HOW TO INSTALL MOODLE
=====================

1.  SET UP A DATABASE

    Create an empty database (eg "moodle") in your database system
    along with a special user (eg "moodle") that has access to that 
    database.  (Don't use the "root" user for the moodle database - 
    it's a security hazard).

    eg for MySQL under a Unix system:

    # mysql -u root -p 
    > CREATE DATABASE moodle;
    > GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,CREATE,DROP,INDEX,ALTER ON moodle.* 
      TO moodle@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'yourpassword';
    > quit
    # mysqladmin -p reload


2.  EDIT config.php
 
    Edit the configuration file, putting in the database details that you 
    just defined, as well as changing the site address and so on.

    Make sure you specify what type of database you are using.

    eg:

    $CFG->wwwroot   = "http://example.com"; 
    $CFG->dbtype    = "mysqlt";      // eg mysql, mysqlt, postgres ... etc
    $CFG->dbhost    = "localhost";   // eg localhost 
    $CFG->dbname    = "moodle";      // eg moodle
    $CFG->dbuser    = "moodle";
    $CFG->dbpass    = "yourpassword";
    

3.  GO TO THE ADMIN PAGE

    The admin page should now be working at:  http://example.com/admin  

    The first time you access this page, Moodle will automagically 
    create all the tables it needs within your database.

    You will then be asked to create an administration user for
    future access to the admin pages..  
    
    All your further configuration of Moodle can now be done using the
    administration web pages, including:
      
        - creating and deleting courses
        - administering teacher accounts
        - changing site-wide settings
        - adding/deleting modules
    
    Configuration of each course is done by the teachers of that course.
    See the teacher documentation for more information about that.
    
    Have fun and send me feedback so we can continue improving Moodle!
        

Cheers!
