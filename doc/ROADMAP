Roadmap
-------

Here are some of the directions I would like to take
Moodle now it has been released.

- Code audit and clean up.  Standardise tabs, wordwrap.
  Refactor a few bits.

- Full internationalisation.  To start with I've hardcoded 
  all the strings just to get things started and reduce 
  obfuscation during development.  Modular "language packs"
  need to implemented instead. eg using STPhp.
