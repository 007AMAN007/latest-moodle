This files describes API changes in the lesson code.

=== 2.9 ===
lesson_page_type_endofbranch::update in mod/lesson/pagetypes/endofbranch.php
and lesson_page_type_endofcluster::update in mod/lesson/pagetypes/endofcluster.php
have been removed, this is now handled by the base class: lesson_page::update in
locallib.php and the exact same code is executed (it is also executed by the
lesson_page_type_cluster class that previously had no update function).

A third optional boolean parameter $endreached was added to lesson::update_timer to
indicate that end of lesson was reached. This is used by 'completionendreached' custom
completion rule.
